# What is this?

It is a static textbox sender (via osc) for VRChat. It just makes it so that a message of your choice appears (as long as you have the script running) above your head.

# Instructions

- If to run this, you first need to install python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Then edit the "message.json" file and add your message (and save!!!!)
- Then just double click the python file (main.py)
